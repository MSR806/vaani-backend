Meanwhile, Fiona, who has moved in with Alan using her pregnancy as an excuse, is furious about Eva's contract. She expresses her frustration to Alan, who tries to calm her by promising a better deal and dismissing the importance of Eva's ambassador role. Fiona, however, remains determined to secure the deal and resents Eva for always getting what she wants.

The next morning, Eva prepares for the contract signing event. Angela calls to review Eva's schedule, mentioning that the event will be broadcast live. Daniel surprises Eva with a luxurious red gown for the occasion, which he had bought for special events and potential dates. Angela arrives at Eva's place, and Daniel leaves, promising to watch the broadcast.

On their way to the event, Angela reveals a plan by Fiona's fans to humiliate Eva at the airport by pretending to be her fans and spilling ice cream on her outfit. Angela discovered this by joining Fiona's fan group anonymously. Eva finds the plan childish and decides to outsmart them, determined to protect the gown Daniel gave her. The chapter highlights Eva's resolve and her growing relationship with Daniel, while Fiona's jealousy and desperation are emphasized.
