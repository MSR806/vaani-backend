In Chapter 10, Eva silences her phone to avoid Alan's calls after news breaks, and she reflects on her gratitude for Daniel's support as he drives. They share a moment of intimacy, and Eva requests to visit a cherry blossom park, a place tied to past disappointments with Alan. At the park, Eva calls Alan, inviting him to meet her there, intending to make him wait as she had in the past. Alan, motivated by Eva's family status and temperament, agrees to meet her. Meanwhile, Eva and Daniel dine at a nearby restaurant, observing Alan's arrival from a distance. Daniel questions if making Alan wait will ease Eva's anger, to which she responds that she wants him to feel her past frustrations. After an hour, they leave Alan waiting and head to Eva's home to pack her belongings. Daniel admires Eva's photos, and they share a passionate moment, signaling Eva's readiness to start anew with Daniel. Meanwhile, Alan, still waiting, receives a call from Fiona, prompting him to leave and instruct his manager to release a statement about a scandal involving him and Fiona, hoping to mitigate the situation.
