In Chapter 83, Rose returns to her hotel from the airport and receives a call from her brother, Alan. They discuss the stress caused by Eva, who traveled in first class while Rose was left in economy. Rose blames Alan's choice of brides, particularly Fiona, for their troubles and expresses regret for supporting her against Eva. Alan reassures Rose, suggesting Fiona's poor performance is due to bad luck and outlines a plan to undermine Eva. Rose insists on finding Eva's residence to stay nearby.

The next morning, Alan convenes a meeting with Rose and Megan to transition Eva's management to Rose. Despite not being invited, Eva attends, asserting her right to be present. Alan proceeds with the meeting, asking Megan to display Eva's deals, but Megan withholds crucial ones. Alan is surprised by the volume of Eva's pending deals and attempts to control them by promising to manage them himself, unaware that Megan has already been contacted by the companies.

Eva, however, is aware of eight significant deals hidden from Alan, which she values more than the 45 others. Rose is shocked by Eva's popularity and becomes more determined to control her. She underestimates Eva's potential, believing Alan's agency is too small for Eva's growing status. Rose plans to leverage her international contacts to help Eva, but only if Eva complies with her demands, threatening to ruin her otherwise. This chapter highlights the tension between the characters and foreshadows potential conflicts over Eva's career management.
