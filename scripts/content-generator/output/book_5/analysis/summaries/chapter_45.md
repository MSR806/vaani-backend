In Chapter 45, Eva is pleased with the public's reaction to Alan's post, which unintentionally boosts her popularity. She shares her strategy with Daniel, who trusts her despite his concern about Alan's attempt to scapegoat her. Eva reassures Megan and Angela, who are both involved in her plan against Alan. Angela, exhausted from preparations, agrees with Eva to let the public react to Alan's video before they make their next move.

The following day, Eva monitors the online buzz, noting her rising fame and the nickname "Brave Rogers." She decides to capitalize on this momentum. In a video call, Angela confirms that she has sent incriminating records to a contact, who spreads them, causing a scandal for Alan and his agency. Eva's manager, Megan, worriedly informs her about the viral clips, but Eva reveals she released them herself to expose Alan's coercion.

Eva's strategic release of recordings, capturing Alan's unethical demands, turns public opinion in her favor. She instructs Megan to keep her updated on agency developments while allowing Angela to rest. Later, Daniel returns home, ostensibly for a forgotten file, but actually to celebrate Eva's newfound success. He praises her bravery and acknowledges the hard work behind her achievements, emphasizing the support of loved ones in her journey.
