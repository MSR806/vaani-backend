In Chapter 48, Alan faces a major crisis as the president of his agency, with shareholders and board members pressuring him for a solution. His irritation with Eva grows after she refuses to help, and investors threaten to withdraw support unless he resolves the situation within a week. Fiona, unable to leave the agency due to protesting fans, disguises herself to escape, feeling humiliated. Alan, overwhelmed and unable to find a solution with his PR team, receives a call from his sister, Rose, who offers advice.

Rose criticizes Alan's handling of the situation, particularly his relationship with Fiona, and suggests leveraging Eva's popularity to benefit the agency. She advises Alan to hold a press conference, apologize publicly, and support Eva professionally to mitigate the scandal. Rose also proposes an international deal for both models to improve public perception. Alan, initially resistant due to Fiona's potential reaction, eventually agrees, realizing the necessity of Rose's plan.

Throughout the chapter, Alan's emotional turmoil is evident as he grapples with the agency's potential downfall and his personal relationships. Rose's guidance highlights the importance of strategic thinking and ethical behavior, foreshadowing future challenges Alan may face if he fails to heed her advice. The chapter ends with Alan resolving to treat Eva well, remembering a favor he still needs from her.
