In Chapter 70, Fiona is confronted by reporters questioning her identity, which angers her. Eva accuses Fiona of hiring fake reporters, leading to a heated exchange where Eva criticizes Fiona's arrogance and refusal to learn. Mr. Folley intervenes, accusing Fiona of using the Paris trip for self-promotion and credits Eva for allowing Fiona to stay. He orders guards to escort Fiona and her group out of the party, expressing his disappointment. As they are thrown out, Eva feels satisfied, seeing it as the beginning of her revenge.

Outside, Fiona is humiliated and collapses, feeling like a laughing stock. Alan tries to comfort her, but she pushes him away. Alan confronts Rose for not informing them about the situation earlier, suspecting her of sabotaging Fiona. Fiona accuses Rose of intentionally undermining her to elevate Eva, suggesting Rose wants Alan to return to Eva. Rose, angered, defends herself, asserting her loyalty to her family and blaming Fiona for her downfall. The argument escalates, with Rose calling Fiona "lowly trash" for her accusations.

Unbeknownst to them, Daniel is filming the altercation from a nearby car, capturing the entire scene. The chapter highlights themes of betrayal, revenge, and the consequences of arrogance, setting the stage for further conflict.
