In Chapter 2, Eva and Daniel successfully register their marriage, which is a strategic move for both. Eva outlines her conditions for their marriage: it should remain open, private, and uninvolved in each other's personal issues. Daniel agrees but insists Eva move in within three days to convince his parents of their marriage's authenticity. He also warns against any past relationships affecting his reputation. After parting ways, Daniel instructs his assistant to monitor Eva, curious about her sudden decision to marry him.

Eva receives a call from Alan, her ex-fianc√©, who shamelessly asks her to substitute for her sick friend Fiona at an important show, concealing her identity. Despite feeling used, Eva agrees, planning to exact revenge on Alan and Fiona, who are about to marry. The chapter highlights Eva's emotional shift from compliance to determination for revenge, setting the stage for future conflict. The courthouse and Eva's car serve as primary settings, with the chapter foreshadowing Eva's impending confrontation with her past relationships.
