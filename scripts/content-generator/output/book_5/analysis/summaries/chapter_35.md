He suspects divine punishment for past wrongs against Eva and demands a meeting with the cleaning staff to identify the spy, but no one confesses. Meanwhile, Eva receives a grateful call from the maid, whose mother's surgery was funded by Eva. The maid reveals Fiona's coercion to insult Eva for financial gain. Daniel, Eva's husband, is proud of her resilience and invites her to dinner, but she is busy with plans.

Alan's team decides Fiona must apologize to Eva to salvage the agency's reputation, despite Fiona's reluctance. The next day, Fiona faces a media frenzy over a leaked audio implicating her in undermining Eva. Reporters and Eva's fans confront her as she heads to the hospital, accusing her of exploiting Eva's illness for business gains. Fiona is overwhelmed by the hostility and blames Eva for her troubles, vowing revenge. The chapter highlights themes of betrayal, redemption, and the consequences of unethical actions.
