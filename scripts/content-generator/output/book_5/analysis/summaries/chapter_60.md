In Chapter 60, Alan reluctantly agrees to Eva's terms to prevent Fiona from doubting him, despite planning to later boycott the agreement. Eva surprises him with a pre-prepared contract, already approved by the agency's higher-ups, which Alan is forced to sign. This agreement limits Alan's control over Eva's career, granting her more independence. Eva, now partially free from Alan's agency, decides to share the stage with Fiona to prove her superiority and correct public perception. Mr. Folley respects Eva's confidence and independence, acknowledging her sincerity and strength in the competitive entertainment industry.

Eva's manager, Angela, and assistant, Megan, admire her foresight and planning, realizing they have much to learn from her strategic thinking. Eva reveals her intent to prevent Fiona from benefiting from her deals, focusing instead on her upcoming photo shoot. At home, Eva shares a tender moment with her husband, Daniel, before recounting the day's events to him and her team. The chapter concludes with a message from Angela's friend about a hype in the States, sparked by a statement from Alan's sister favoring Fiona and undermining Eva, setting the stage for future conflicts.
