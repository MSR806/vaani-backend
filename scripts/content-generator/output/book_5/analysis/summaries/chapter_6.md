In Chapter 6, Daniel refrains from confronting Alan, handing the phone to Eva, who answers Alan's call on speaker. Alan, upset, informs Eva about a controversial statement released by her manager, Angela, which has caused trouble for the agency. He insists Eva attend a press conference to clear the agency's name. Eva, irritated by Alan's demands, ends the call. Daniel reassures her of his support.

The next day, Daniel drives Eva to Alan's agency, where she faces hostility from staff who suspect her involvement in the scandal. In Alan's office, he accuses Eva of being complicit with Angela and demands she take responsibility at the press conference. Eva feigns sadness, noting Alan's favoritism towards Fiona. Alan insists Eva blame Angela to protect the agency, promising it will be the last time she has to do such a thing. Eva reluctantly agrees, but internally plans to counter Alan's manipulation.

After Alan leaves, Eva contacts Angela, revealing Alan's plan to scapegoat her. Angela, supportive, vows to help Eva become an international supermodel. The chapter explores themes of manipulation, loyalty, and empowerment, setting the stage for Eva's strategic response to the press conference.
