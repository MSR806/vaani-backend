In Chapter 32, Alan leaves a restaurant and returns to his agency, noticing Angela driving Eva's car, which raises his suspicions about Eva's behavior. Despite their past intimacy, Eva now avoids him, and his usual charm fails. That evening, Alan visits Eva's home under the guise of concern, but Angela, who dislikes him, informs him Eva is out. Alan insists on waiting inside, noticing Eva's pictures are missing. Angela retreats to avoid confrontation, and Alan leaves when Fiona calls about her dizziness. Unbeknownst to Alan, Fiona's assistant tracks his visit to Eva's.

The next day, Eva, while gardening, receives a call from Alan questioning her absence the previous night. She repeats Angela's excuse of a headache and cuts the call short, amused by Alan's concern. Later, Eva's manager Megan calls to relay Alan's demand for Eva to sign a commercial deal. Eva declines, suggesting Fiona take it instead, angering Fiona, who feels mocked. Fiona urges Alan to use marriage as leverage over Eva, but Megan finds their ignorance of Eva's change amusing.

Alan's repeated calls to Eva go unanswered until he receives a message claiming her illness has worsened. Frustrated, Alan suspects Eva is deceiving him. Fiona, reading the message, attempts to call Eva, who then switches off her phone, signaling her and Angela's plan is progressing. Angela, meanwhile, is startled by a visitor in a suit while showering, fearing he might be dangerous. In a comedic turn, she attempts to defend herself with a frying pan but trips, accidentally losing her towel in front of the man.
