In Chapter 9, Eva visits Fiona at the hospital, escorted by Alan's assistant. Upon arrival, she encounters Fiona's assistant, who previously blamed her for a mishap to save his job. Eva asserts her family's influence, causing the assistant to back down. Inside, Fiona, pretending to be a victim, proposes a live broadcast to restore Eva's reputation, suggesting a scene where Eva wipes her forehead to gain public sympathy. Eva, frustrated by Fiona's manipulative tactics, refuses to apologize, leading to a confrontation recorded by Fiona's assistant and posted online, sparking public outrage against Eva.

As reporters swarm, Fiona continues her act, but Alan, watching the events unfold, publicly disassociates from Eva.
