In Chapter 58, a meeting is held at Lush headquarters to finalize a contract with a model named Fiona. Mr. Folley, who is in charge, arrives and surprises everyone by announcing he wants to change models. Rose, who is confident about Fiona's selection, is shocked when Mr. Folley reveals he no longer wishes to work with Fiona due to her lack of professionalism and his realization of a better option. He accuses Rose of deceiving him about Eva, a model she had dismissed, who is actually a renowned professional mentored by the powerful Mrs. Chloe Leroy. Mr. Folley expresses his anger at being misled and embarrassed in front of Mrs. Leroy at a recent fashion exhibition.

Despite Rose's attempts to salvage the situation, Mr. Folley insists that unless his preferred model agrees to work with Fiona, there will be no contract. The tension escalates when Eva herself enters the room, revealing she is the model Mr. Folley wants. This revelation leaves Rose, Alan, and Fiona stunned and embarrassed, as they realize Eva's influence and the mistake they made in underestimating her. The chapter highlights themes of deception, professional integrity, and the consequences of underestimating others.
