In Chapter 42, Eva confronts Alan and the event manager after being accused of disrupting an event. The event manager demands an apology, while Alan threatens Eva, claiming she won't succeed in the industry without him. Eva refuses, mocking Alan's arrogance and revealing her awareness of her contractual rights. Alan attempts to intimidate her, but Eva is protected by Daniel's bodyguards, who prevent Alan from physically assaulting her. Despite Alan's threats to damage her reputation, Eva remains unfazed, asserting her independence and legal knowledge.

The confrontation escalates when Alan accuses Eva of seeking revenge due to their breakup, but she dismisses his emotional manipulation. The situation takes a turn when two men arrive and arrest the event manager for fraud, revealing his illegal activities. This development inadvertently benefits Alan, as he avoids compensating the manager. However, Alan is left speechless and cornered by Eva's newfound assertiveness and influence, realizing she has outmaneuvered him. Eva's transformation from a submissive figure to a powerful, independent woman is evident, as she declares her indifference to Alan's fate, marking a significant shift in her character.
