In Chapter 40, Daniel, despite promising not to interfere in Eva's affairs, is determined to help her because he admires her independence and virtue. He learns from Luke that a company has been illegally using Eva's image to promote harmful products, which she had previously refused to endorse, causing the company's downfall. Daniel devises a plan to address the issue while maintaining a supportive front for Eva.

On Monday, Eva prepares for an important event with her escorts, Megan and Angela. Eva has instructed Megan to pretend to cooperate with Alan and his mistress to avoid suspicion. At the agency, Alan ensures Eva memorizes a script to clear his mistress's name, under the guise of supporting her. Eva, aware of Alan's manipulation, remains calm but internally angry.

As the event begins, Eva, dressed impeccably, reflects on her journey and the support she has received from Megan, who praises Eva's strength and professionalism. Eva is determined to reclaim her reputation and is grateful for Daniel's support, realizing her past with Alan led her to someone who truly deserves her. The chapter highlights Eva's resilience and the strategic planning behind her public appearance.
