In Chapter 67, Eva wakes up after a tiring day and shares a tender morning with her husband, Daniel, before he leaves for work. Their moment is interrupted by Angie, who informs Eva about a spiteful post by Rose that boosts Fiona's recognition, causing Eva's fans to lose hope. Eva remains patient, confident that her hard work will eventually pay off. Megan receives a call from Mr. Folley, inviting them to a lunch party celebrating the magazine shoot's conclusion. 

At the party, Eva observes Fiona and Alan announcing their engagement, which is met with applause. Alan credits Eva for bringing them together, a move intended to belittle her. Eva, unfazed, is supported by Angie, who looks forward to the couple learning about Eva's marriage to Daniel. Mr. Folley watches the events unfold, hinting at his awareness of the underlying tensions.

Rose confronts Eva, attempting to provoke jealousy over Fiona's rising fame and potential magazine cover win. Eva, however, remains confident, dismissing Rose's attempts to undermine her. The chapter highlights Eva's resilience and the industry's competitive nature, foreshadowing future confrontations and the importance of perseverance over superficial success.
