In Chapter 71, Daniel records a confrontation involving Rose and Fiona, anticipating its future utility. After Rose leaves angrily, Fiona, upset and cursing Eva, sits in tears, realizing her downfall. Daniel, angered by Fiona's words against his wife, decides to retaliate by instructing his assistant, Luke, to prepare a surprise for their adversaries, confident that Eva will appreciate his actions despite her previous instructions.

Later, at an event, Eva is surprised by Daniel's unexpected arrival. Invited on stage by Mr. Folley, Daniel is celebrated by attendees and reporters. Mr. Folley suggests Daniel and Eva open the dance floor, leading to a public dance that Daniel enjoys, cherishing the moment with Eva. Despite the public setting, Eva reminds Daniel of the need to maintain discretion to avoid rumors, though Daniel is eager to reveal their marriage eventually.

After the dance, Eva, feeling unwell due to earlier events, is offered assistance by Mr. Folley, who admires her professionalism. Daniel insists on escorting her, and Mr. Folley agrees, ensuring no pictures are taken to keep the focus on the magazine event. Daniel, however, has already ensured that any media coverage of their dance is suppressed, threatening reporters with job loss if they share any footage. This chapter highlights Daniel's protective nature towards Eva and sets the stage for potential future conflicts with their adversaries.
