In Chapter 57, Eva, accompanied by Mrs. Leroy, leaves Mr. Folley, who is visibly regretful of his past decisions. Mrs. Leroy discusses lucrative international offers with Eva, but Eva declines, having gained clarity on her career goals. She is determined to start anew and has announced her comeback. After the exhibition, Mr. Folley stops Eva's car to request her participation in a photoshoot for Lush's front cover, valuing her over his current partner, Rose. Eva's strategic maneuvering has turned the tables on Rose, and she anticipates Rose's reaction to this shift in alliances.

Upon returning home, Eva is greeted by her curious friend Angela and manager Megan. Before she can share her news, she receives a call from Alan, who coldly suggests she return to the U.S., claiming Lush has no use for her. Alan's lies and condescending remarks about Eva's worth and her past relationship with him provoke her anger, but she vows to reclaim what she is owed. Reflecting on her past with Alan, Eva appreciates her supportive husband, Daniel, who comforts her with his presence and reassures her to endure and focus on the future. The chapter highlights Eva's resolve to overcome past setbacks and embrace her newfound independence and strength.
