In Chapter 64, Eva completes a successful photo shoot, impressing the photographer and crew. As she exits, Fiona enters with arrogance, colliding with Eva. The photographer anticipates Fiona's professionalism but is quickly disappointed by her stiff demeanor and lack of posing skills. Fiona argues with the photographer, blaming him for not providing direction. Alan, Fiona's partner, arrives to diffuse the situation, urging Fiona to cooperate. Despite receiving guidance, Fiona continues to perform poorly, frustrating the photographer.

After the shoot, Fiona, oblivious to her shortcomings, proudly asks for feedback and receives a disingenuous compliment. Meanwhile, Eva encounters Fiona's assistant, Lydia, who expresses disdain towards her. Inside the waiting room, Eva sees Fiona and Alan kissing, but remains indifferent, which frustrates Fiona. Alan reminds Fiona of their goals, cautioning her against jeopardizing their plans. As Eva leaves, Alan follows her, calling out to her, hinting at a potential confrontation or discussion. The chapter highlights the contrast between Eva's professionalism and Fiona's ineptitude, along with the tension between the characters.
