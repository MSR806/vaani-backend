Alan is shocked to find himself face-to-face with Daniel, a man he idolizes, and is embarrassed by the situation. Daniel reprimands Alan for attempting to hit a woman and insists he apologize to Eva. Alan, eager to maintain a good impression on Daniel, reluctantly complies.

After the confrontation, Daniel reveals he planned to take Eva to lunch, having rented a private restaurant. Angela, Eva's friend, joins them, bringing good news.
