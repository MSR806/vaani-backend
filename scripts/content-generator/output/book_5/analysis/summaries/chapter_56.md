In Chapter 56, Angela and Megan are frustrated by the disrespect Eva faced from Rose and Fiona, who plan to replace her despite their friendship. Eva surprises them by suggesting they attend an influential party that evening, hinting at a plan to assert her status. The event is an exhibition attended by key figures in the entertainment industry, including people from Lush. Eva arrives elegantly dressed, capturing attention, including that of Mr. Folley, who had previously rejected her. He mistakenly assumes Eva is there to seek a modeling opportunity, but Eva confidently refutes his assumptions.

Eva's mentor, Mrs. Leroy, a prominent figure in the fashion industry and editor of a major French magazine, notices the argument and intervenes. She scolds Mr. Folley for underestimating Eva, revealing Eva's extensive modeling background and their close relationship. Mrs. Leroy defends Eva, emphasizing her talent and experience, and offers her support. Mr. Folley, realizing his mistake, apologizes profusely. The chapter highlights Eva's strategic positioning within the industry and her strong connections, setting the stage for her to reclaim her dignity and status.
