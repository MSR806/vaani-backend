In Chapter 77, Eva and Megan return to the car in high spirits, with Rose accompanying them. Rose hands Eva a phone call from Alan, who is surprised by Eva's lack of reaction to his sister being her new manager. Alan, frustrated by Eva's calm demeanor, explains that he wants Eva and his sister to resolve their differences during their trip to Japan. He warns Eva about her fame's fleeting nature before hanging up. At the airport, Eva arranges for her car to be picked up, revealing her assistant is also traveling to Japan.

Upon arriving in Japan, Eva quickly prepares for a commercial shoot, determined to demonstrate her dedication despite her fatigue. She is excited to compete with top international models, unlike her past experiences with Fiona. However, a photographer initially doubts Eva's capabilities due to her calm demeanor but is soon impressed by Eva's humility and charisma, recognizing her potential.

Meanwhile, Rose observes with jealousy and regret, reflecting on her brother's betrayal of Eva and her own decisions to support him. Despite her feelings, Rose acknowledges she would make the same choices again, citing family loyalty. The chapter highlights themes of professional rivalry, personal growth, and the complexities of relationships.
