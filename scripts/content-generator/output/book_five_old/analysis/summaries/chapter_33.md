In Chapter 33, Angela is startled by a man in her home and mistakenly assumes he is a kidnapper. After a brief confrontation where she kicks him, Angela receives a call from Eva, revealing the man, Luke, was sent by Eva to pick her up. Angela apologizes, and they drive to Eva's home. There, Angela and Eva discuss their plans, interrupted by a call from Alan, who is looking for Eva. Angela deceives Alan by pretending there's a bad connection and hangs up, leading to laughter between the women.

The scene shifts to Thursday, where Eva, with Daniel's support, prepares for a confrontation at the agency. She uses makeup to appear ill, intending to manipulate Alan and Fiona. Angela pushes Eva in a wheelchair to Alan's office, where Eva feigns weakness. Alan, oblivious to Eva's act, demands she sign a deal, but Eva refuses, citing her illness and insisting Fiona take the deal. Alan's dismissive attitude angers Eva, who pretends to faint, escalating the tension. This chapter highlights themes of deception and manipulation, with Eva and Angela cleverly outmaneuvering their adversaries.
