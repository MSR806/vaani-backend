In Chapter 55, Eva wakes early to attend a meeting at Lush's headquarters, discovering a plot by Alan to make her arrive late by sending a false schedule. Thanks to her husband, she learns the true meeting time and arrives early, thwarting the plan. Angela and Megan, also deceived by Alan, express their frustration, and Eva invites them to move in with her to avoid further manipulation.

At the headquarters, Fiona and Rose are shocked to see Eva arrive on time, having expected her to be late and face consequences. Fiona, supported by Alan and Rose, drops her pretense of niceness, while Rose, the mastermind, remains determined to undermine Eva.

During the meeting, Mr. Folley, influenced by Rose's lies, decides to replace Eva, claiming she doesn't fit the shoot's theme. Eva calmly confronts him, hinting at underlying biases. Fiona attempts to appear moral, but Eva asserts her significance to the project. As Eva leaves, she warns Mr. Folley of his impending regret over his decision. Angela and Megan, who were barred from the meeting, await Eva in the lobby, indicating their support. The chapter highlights themes of deception, resilience, and the power dynamics within the modeling industry.
