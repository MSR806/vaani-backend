In Chapter 20, Eva and Angela board a flight, and Angela informs Eva that the video they posted has successfully turned public opinion against Fiona, who is now being criticized. Eva expresses satisfaction at Fiona's downfall. Meanwhile, Alan observes the backlash against Fiona and is relieved not to be implicated. Fiona, distressed by the negative attention, seeks Alan's help. He advises her to apologize to Eva to regain public sympathy, but Fiona adamantly refuses.

Eva receives a congratulatory message from Daniel about handling Fiona. As Eva and Angela arrive at their hotel, Angela suggests Eva rest while she informs the manager about their arrival. Eva, exhausted, agrees. She receives a call from Daniel, who expresses that he misses her, a sentiment that surprises Eva given Daniel's typically cold demeanor. Their conversation ends abruptly, leaving Eva puzzled.

Later, Angela returns to inform Eva about the next day's schedule and arranges for food and rest. Eva prepares for bed but is interrupted by a late-night knock at the door, revealing an unexpected visitor. This chapter highlights Eva's strategic victory over Fiona, the strained dynamics between Fiona and Alan, and the budding emotional connection between Eva and Daniel.
