In Chapter 74, Alan receives a call from his sister, Rose, who informs him she was fired due to Fiona's actions, which brought shame to her company. Rose blames Alan for introducing Fiona, and Alan promises to employ her and help with her compensation. Needing money, Alan plans to change Eva's manager to disrupt her progress, believing Megan was too supportive of Eva. However, Eva's nonchalant acceptance of the change surprises him, as she remains unfazed by his tactics. Alan attempts to manipulate Eva into helping Fiona with a new collaboration, but Eva dismisses his efforts, showing her independence and growth from his previous emotional manipulations.

Later, at home, Eva shares the day's events with her husband, Daniel, who is supportive and amused by Alan's failed attempts. Daniel's laughter suggests he might have influenced the situation, hinting at his protective nature towards Eva. The chapter highlights Eva's emotional resilience and independence, contrasting with Alan's desperation and manipulative behavior.
