In Chapter 84, after a meeting, Eva gives Megan a ride home, discussing Rose's dismissive attitude towards Eva's success. Megan criticizes Rose's attempt to control Eva's career, but Eva is determined to pursue her international modeling goals independently. At home, Eva shares with Angela how Rose plans to limit her career to local markets, which Eva finds laughable given her international recognition. Angela supports Eva's resolve to protect her career from Rose and Alan's manipulations. Eva reflects on her past sacrifices for Alan and regrets the time wasted.

The next day, Eva talks to her husband, Daniel, on the phone, reassuring him not to worry about her and to rest instead of helping her. She appreciates his support but insists on handling her affairs independently.

Later, Eva attends a party at a hotel, which was supposed to be a small gathering but turns out larger due to Alan's influence. Alan arrives with his lover, Fiona, and tries to provoke Eva by flaunting their relationship. Eva remains unfazed and counters Fiona's insults about her magazine success with sharp retorts, asserting her achievements are due to hard work, not luck. Fiona is visibly angered by Eva's confidence and composure, realizing Eva is no longer easily intimidated. The chapter highlights Eva's growth and determination to assert her independence against those who seek to undermine her.
