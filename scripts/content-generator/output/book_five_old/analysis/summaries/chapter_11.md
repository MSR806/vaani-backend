In Chapter 11, Alan rushes home after instructing his assistant about a press release, puzzled by Eva's absence. At home, he finds Fiona feigning distress on the floor, claiming she came to find him due to stomach pain. Alan reassures her, promising to protect her and their child, and mentions a new press release, which pleases Fiona. Meanwhile, Eva's manager, Angela, is upset by the news of Alan's release, suspecting it harms Eva's reputation.

Elsewhere, Eva returns home with Daniel, who insists on providing for her and discourages using items from her past relationship. Their intimacy is interrupted by a call from Angela, who is concerned about Eva's whereabouts. Eva arranges for Angela to be picked up, as Daniel prefers Eva not to go out at night. Angela, suspicious and curious, is taken to an opulent estate where Eva now resides.

Upon arrival, Angela is shocked by the luxury and learns from Eva that she has moved out and is married. Daniel, revealed as Eva's husband, joins them, confirming Angela's suspicions about his support for Eva during a public incident. The chapter explores themes of deception, loyalty, and the contrast between public perception and private realities.
