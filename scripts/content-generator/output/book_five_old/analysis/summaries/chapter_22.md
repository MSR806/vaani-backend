In Chapter 22, after Eva's shoot ends, she texts Daniel to pick her up, surprised by his quick arrival. Daniel compliments her beauty, but Eva seems distant, not noticing his frown. Despite their marriage being for convenience, Daniel desires a genuine connection. At the hotel, Daniel carries Eva to their room, sharing an intimate moment interrupted by a call from Alan, Eva's agent. Alan informs her of a new manager due to her recent deal, which Eva acknowledges tersely before resuming her time with Daniel.

The next morning, Eva and Angela head to the agency, where Eva meets her new manager, who greets her coldly, raising Eva's suspicions. Alan discusses an incident involving Fiona's fans, insisting Fiona is innocent and requesting Eva's support in a public apology to restore Fiona's reputation. Eva, skeptical of Fiona's innocence and aware of Alan's motives to exploit her rising popularity, refuses to comply. Alan's frustration surfaces, but Eva stands firm, asserting her independence and leaving his office. This chapter highlights Eva's growing assertiveness and the tension between personal and professional relationships.
