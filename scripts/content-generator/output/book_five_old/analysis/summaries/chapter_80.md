Angela praises Eva's generosity, while Rose objects, fearing unplanned chaos. However, Eva insists, supported by her manager Megan, leaving Rose speechless.

This event marks a significant moment in Eva's career, emphasizing her gratitude and the strong bond with her fans, setting the stage for potential future conflicts and developments.
