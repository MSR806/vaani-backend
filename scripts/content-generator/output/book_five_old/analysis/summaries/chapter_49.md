In Chapter 49, Alan arrives at Fiona's apartment to find her distraught over the humiliation she faced at the agency. He comforts her, promising to replace the janitors who witnessed her embarrassment and reveals a plan involving a press conference to leverage Eva's popularity. Fiona, however, refuses to participate due to her disdain for Eva. Alan, realizing Fiona's stubbornness, decides to release a public statement instead, announcing a deal for Eva and Fiona with an international cosmetics company, Lush.

The public reacts negatively, questioning Alan's decision to pair the rival models. Despite the backlash, some fans support Fiona's international opportunity. Eva, pleased with the development, sees it as a chance to prove her superiority over Fiona. Her manager, Megan, advises her to attend the agency, which Eva agrees to, acknowledging the public perception if she declined.

The next day, Eva arrives at the agency with a bodyguard, courtesy of her husband Daniel, who is concerned for her safety. Fiona, regaining her confidence, enters arrogantly but is ignored by the staff, who respect Eva. Fiona attempts to provoke Eva, but Eva counters with sarcasm, highlighting Fiona's reliance on her popularity. This exchange underscores the ongoing rivalry and sets the stage for further conflict.
