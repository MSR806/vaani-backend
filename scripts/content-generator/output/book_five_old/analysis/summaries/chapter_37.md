In Chapter 37, Eva is elated as she leaves the hospital, her plan having succeeded. Daniel, missing Eva's presence at home, drives her to her previous apartment where she plans to meet Alan, anticipating his deceitful explanations. In the car, Daniel expresses his longing for Eva, sharing a tender moment, while Angela is distracted by thoughts of Luke. Upon arrival, Eva suggests Daniel wait to pick her up after her meeting with Alan.

Inside, Eva prepares for Alan's arrival, emotionally drained from the day's events. As predicted, Alan arrives, and Angela initially confronts him, buying Eva time to compose herself. Alan attempts to explain away his infidelity with Fiona, but Eva interrupts, presenting undeniable evidence of his betrayalâ€”a video of him and Fiona in a compromising situation.

Alan's attempts to dismiss the evidence as fake are futile, and his assistant calls, alerting him to the media frenzy the scandal has caused. Desperate, Alan pleads for Eva's help, but she firmly ends their relationship, refusing to be manipulated. As Alan leaves, Daniel, who has been observing, resolves to use his media connections to ensure Alan's downfall is publicized, seeking retribution for Eva's pain. The chapter highlights themes of betrayal, empowerment, and the consequences of deceit.
