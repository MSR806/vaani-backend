In Chapter 65, Eva encounters Alan, who sarcastically comments on her calm demeanor, expressing hope that she won't cause trouble for Fiona, his girlfriend. Eva retorts, mocking Fiona. The scene shifts to a dual photoshoot where Eva and Fiona are models. Fiona had earlier swapped outfits with Eva, believing they suited her better, unaware that Eva had strategically chosen clothes that would make Fiona blend into the background. Eva, informed by her husband Daniel, had planned this to ensure her own success.

During the shoot, Fiona arrogantly positions herself to overshadow Eva, but Eva's choice of angle and outfit earns her praise from the photographer, unbeknownst to Fiona, who misinterprets the French praise as directed at her. After the shoot, the photographer commends Eva's professionalism, hinting at her potential for future success.

Outside, Alan confronts Eva, suspicious of her conversation with the photographer, accusing her of trying to seduce him for praise. Eva defends herself, criticizing Fiona, which angers Alan. He attempts to slap Eva, but his hand is stopped by an unexpected person, leaving the chapter on a cliffhanger. This chapter highlights Eva's strategic thinking, her strained relationship with Fiona and Alan, and foreshadows potential conflict resolution.
