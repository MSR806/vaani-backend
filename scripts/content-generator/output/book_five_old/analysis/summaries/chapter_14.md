In Chapter 14, Alan and Fiona engage in a tense discussion about a modeling deal. Fiona, upset, pressures Alan to convince Eva to relinquish the deal to her, arguing that Eva, who is retiring and engaged to Alan, doesn't need it. Alan assures Fiona he'll handle it, exploiting Eva's past compliance and their relationship. When Eva enters, Alan feigns concern over misleading online photos, but Eva sees through his lies. Alan tries to manipulate Eva into giving up the deal, citing Fiona's injury and the company's interests. Eva, however, stands firm, questioning the necessity of the swap and challenging Alan's authority. Despite Fiona's insistence and Alan's attempt to call the brand manager, Eva boldly declares she will accept the deal, defying their expectations and asserting her independence. This chapter highlights Eva's growing resistance to manipulation and the tension between personal and professional interests.
