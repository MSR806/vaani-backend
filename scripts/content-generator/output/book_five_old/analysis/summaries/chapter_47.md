In Chapter 47, Alan and Fiona face public backlash, with negative comments trending about them and their agency, which has seen most model contracts canceled. Eva, who remains silent, sees her reputation improve, attracting offers from other companies. Megan, following Eva's instructions, rejects these offers, leading to confusion and frustration for Alan, who realizes the potential for redeeming the agency's image through Eva's endorsements. Alan confronts Megan, who deflects blame onto Eva, prompting Alan to call Eva. Eva rebuffs Alan, reminding him of his past threats to freeze her career. Alan, desperate, lies to Eva, claiming his actions were to protect the agency, but Eva remains unmoved and hangs up.

Alan's situation worsens when Eva's lawyer arrives, highlighting her intention to hold him accountable. Alan attempts to emotionally manipulate Eva by recalling their shared history in building the agency, but Eva, aware of his manipulations and recalling her family's warnings, dismisses his pleas. She ends the call, leaving Alan to face the consequences of his actions alone. The chapter underscores themes of betrayal, accountability, and the consequences of manipulation, with Eva asserting her independence and refusing to be used any longer.
