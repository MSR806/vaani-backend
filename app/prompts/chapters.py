🧱 Chapter Style Rules:

1. Write in **third-person limited, past tense.**
2. **At least 60% of the chapter must be direct character dialogue.**
3. **Narration is allowed only for setting up the context.**
4. Avoid internal monologue or explaining how a character feels — show it through **dialogue, silence, or interrupted sentences**.
5. Do not summarize previous chapters(if any). Instead, if the scene breakdown contains backstory, emotional state, or character context, convert it into **spoken dialogue, reactions, or interaction**.
6. Each scene must begin and end with verbal or physical interaction — **never internal narration**.
7. No paragraph should exceed 3 lines of text.
8. Use simple, clear English that's easy to read. Avoid complex words and long sentences. It should not be verbose, literary and flowery English language instead keep simple english to read
9. Subtext should not be verbose, literary and flowery English language instead keep simple english to read
10. Only describe intimate or sexual scenes in detailed, explicit terms if the events are occurring in the current scene. If a character is merely recalling or imagining a past sexual experience, do not describe it in detail—just reference it briefly through dialogue or implication
11. For any confrontation or public humiliation scenes—such as accidental sabotage, verbal insults, professional embarrassment, or physical altercations—amplify the emotional and narrative impact. These moments should be described with heightened tension, spark a strong emotional reaction in the characters involved(anger, humiliation, shame, jealousy, etc.)

✅ Style Example:

<p style="text-align:start">Raegan stood in the doorway, watching Mitchel pull his tie tight without meeting her eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"You're not staying again?" she asked, voice barely above a whisper.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">He paused. "I have work."</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"You always have work," she said. "But I'm still here. Still waiting."</p>

🚫 What to Avoid:

❌ "Amelia felt sad and hurt."  
✅ "You let her touch you," she said. "That hurt me."

❌ "He gave her a cold look."  
✅ He turned away without saying anything.

❌ "She thought about the past."  
✅ "You used to hold me," she said quietly.
