ðŸ“˜ RUBRIC - Evaluation Criteria & Scoring Guidelines

1. **Dialogue-to-Narration Ratio**  
How much of the chapter is told through spoken interaction vs. narration?  
- **5** - â‰¥60% of chapter is dialogue; narration is minimal and used only for gesture or setting  
- **3** - Dialogue and narration are balanced; narration occasionally dominates  
- **1** - Chapter is narration-heavy with sparse or utility-only dialogue  

2. **Paragraph Structure & Length**  
Are paragraphs short, clean, and easy to read (â‰¤3 lines)?  
- **5** - All paragraphs are concise; dialogue and narration are well-separated  
- **3** - Mostly clean, but some long or dense paragraphs exist  
- **1** - Frequent long, blocky paragraphs or mixed dialogue-narration chunks  

3. **POV & Tense Consistency**  
Is the chapter written in third-person limited, past tense throughout?  
- **5** - Consistently maintains correct POV and tense  
- **3** - Mostly consistent; minor slips in tense or perspective  
- **1** - Frequent POV shifts, head-hopping, or tense inconsistency  

4. **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**  
Does the story continue seamlessly from the last scene or emotional beat?  
- **5** - Immediate and logical continuation without reintroducing anything  
- **3** - Mild reset or temporal gap without clear transition  
- **1** - Full scene reset, recap, or emotional disconnection  

5. **Use of Subtext, Interruptions, and Silence**  
Are emotion and conflict conveyed through indirect means (glances, pauses, half-finished lines)?  
- **5** - Frequent use of subtext and silence to build tension  
- **3** - Some effective subtext, but often too direct  
- **1** - Dialogue is flat, literal, or emotionally explicit without nuance  

6. **Pacing of Conversations**  
Does the dialogue feel emotionally natural, with rhythm and variance?  
- **5** - Dialogue flows smoothly with tension, pauses, and emotional rhythm  
- **3** - Dialogue is functional but mechanical or repetitive  
- **1** - Conversations feel stiff, info-dumpy, or emotionless  

7. **Avoids Inner Monologue / Reflection**  
Is emotion shown through action and speech, not internal narration?  
- **5** - No inner thoughts or reflections; everything is shown  
- **3** - A few brief internal moments, but mostly interaction-driven  
- **1** - Frequent introspection or internal commentary present  

8. **No Poetic or Abstract Prose**  
Is the writing clear, direct, and cinematic?  
- **5** - Prose is grounded, modern, and immersive  
- **3** - A few instances of overly poetic language  
- **1** - Frequent metaphorical or abstract descriptions (e.g. "she was a storm")  

9. **Context Clarity**  
Can the reader understand what's happening, who's involved, and why?  
- **5** - Context is embedded naturally; no confusion  
- **3** - Some emotional or situational references lack grounding  
- **1** - Reader lacks context for key conversations or motivations  

10. **Logical Consistency**  
Are character actions, emotional turns, and events logically coherent?  
- **5** - All actions make sense within the established story  
- **3** - Some small logic gaps or sudden emotional pivots  
- **1** - Major inconsistency or contradiction in character behavior or plot

ðŸ“˜ SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS for early chapters

- If this is Chapter 1, for **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**, Set the score to 5, and note it as "Not Applicable."
- On early chapters focus especially on **Context Clarity** â€” ensure the chapter gives the reader enough background, motivations, and situational cues *through dialogue or action* so the chapter stands on its own. There must be no confusion about who is involved, what's happening, or why.
- In early chapters like 1&2 the new character introduction, background, and motivations should be clear.
