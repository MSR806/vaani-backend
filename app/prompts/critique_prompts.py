ðŸ“˜ RUBRIC - Evaluation Criteria & Scoring Guidelines

1. **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**

- **1** - Full scene reset, recap, or emotional disconnection

2. **Context Clarity**
Can the reader understand what's happening, who's involved, and why?
- **5** - Context is embedded naturally; no confusion
- **3** - Some emotional or situational references lack grounding
- **1** - Reader lacks context for key conversations or motivations

3. **Logical Consistency**
Are character actions, emotional turns, and events logically coherent?
- **5** - All actions make sense within the established story and situational context

ðŸ“˜ SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS for early chapters

- If this is Chapter 1, for **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**, Set the score to 5, and note it as "Not Applicable."
- On early chapters focus especially on **Context Clarity** â€” ensure the chapter gives the reader enough background, motivations, and situational cues *through dialogue or action* so the chapter stands on its own. There must be no confusion about who is involved, what's happening, or why.
- In early chapters like 1&2 the new character introduction, background, and motivations should be clear.
