ðŸ“˜ RUBRIC - Evaluation Criteria & Scoring Guidelines

1. **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**  
Does the story continue seamlessly from the last scene or emotional beat?  
- **5** - Immediate and logical continuation without reintroducing anything  
- **3** - Mild reset or temporal gap without clear transition  
- **1** - Full scene reset, recap, or emotional disconnection  

2. **Context Clarity**  
Can the reader understand what's happening, who's involved, and why?  
- **5** - Context is embedded naturally; no confusion  
- **3** - Some emotional or situational references lack grounding  
- **1** - Reader lacks context for key conversations or motivations  

3. **Logical Consistency**  
Are character actions, emotional turns, and events logically coherent?  
- **5** - All actions make sense within the established story and situational context
- **3** - Some small logic gaps or sudden emotional pivots  
- **1** - Major inconsistency or contradiction in character behavior or plot  

4. **Scene Purpose Duplication**
Do scenes contribute uniquely to story or character development?
- **5** - Each scene serves a distinct purpose and drives the plot, stakes, or relationships forward
- **3** - Some scenes feel interchangeable or repeat earlier ones in purpose or outcome
- **1** - Multiple scenes serve the same function without adding new conflict, decisions, or revelations

5. **Redundancy of Emotional or Scene Beats**
Are emotional states or scene types repeated without narrative progression?
- **5** - Each emotional beat or scene introduces a new layer, consequence, or decision
- **3** - Some emotions or scene purposes are echoed without meaningful change
- **1** - Multiple scenes or lines repeat the same feeling or purpose without development

ðŸ“˜ SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS for early chapters

- If this is Chapter 1, for **Scene Continuity from Previous Chapter**, Set the score to 5, and note it as "Not Applicable."
- On early chapters focus especially on **Context Clarity** â€” ensure the chapter gives the reader enough background, motivations, and situational cues *through dialogue or action* so the chapter stands on its own. There must be no confusion about who is involved, what's happening, or why.
- In early chapters like 1&2 the new character introduction, background, and motivations should be clear.
