For each scene in the chapter, please provide the scene number, title, and content using the following format with clear delimiters:

<scene-1>
<title>Scene Title Here</title>
Content of the first scene goes here. Write a concise and clear description of what happens in this scene.
</scene-1>

<scene-2>
<title>Another Scene Title</title>
Content of the second scene goes here. Make sure to be descriptive but concise.
</scene-2>

And so on for additional scenes...
