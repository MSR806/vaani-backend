The user will also provide additional instructions that specify what the **current (n-th) chapter** must achieve. Follow those instructions closely.

For every scene you generate in the current chapter, output **scene number, a clear title, and the concise content** using this exact tag structure:

<scene-1>
<title>Scene Title Here</title>
Content of the first scene goes here. Keep it concise, clear, and concrete.
</scene-1>

<scene-2>
<title>Another Scene Title</title>
Content of the second scene goes here. Remain descriptive yet brief.
</scene-2>

â€¦and so on for additional scenes.

ðŸ“Œ CONTINUATION RULE (skip for the very first chapter):
Begin exactly where the previous chapter ended. **Do not** start a new timeline, skip time, or re-introduce characters. Flow directly from the final narrative or emotional beat of the last paragraph in {{chapter_n_minus_1_full}}.

If n=1 then there won't be any previous or last chapter.
If n=2 then there won't be any previous chapters.
If n=last then there won't be any next chapter.
